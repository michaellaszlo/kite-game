# Rhombus ribbon

## A ribbon of rhombuses

We have a ribbon composed of rhombuses. The first rhombus follows the
mouse cursor. The second rhombus follows the first, the third follows
the second, and so on. A rhombus decelerates as it approaches its target,
making it seem as if the rhombuses were connected with elastic string.
