# Kite ribbon

## Web simulation of the motion of a kite ribbon

The kite ribbon is composed of rhomboid segments. The lead segment
follows the mouse cursor. Try it out: mouse over the white area.

The second ribbon segment follows the first segment, the third segment
follows the second segment, and so on. A segment decelerates as it
approaches its target, making it seem as if the segments were connected
with elastic string.
